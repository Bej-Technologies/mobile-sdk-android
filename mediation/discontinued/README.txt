discontinued folder contains adapters that are no longer actively maintained or supported

We saw little to no usage for some of the mediation adapters that are included in the Mobile SDK. We will NOT be actively maintaining or supporting the adapters in the list (see below) from the SDKv7.7 release onwards.

Amazon
InMobi
Millennial Media
Mopub

We will stop uploading them to Maven.

Please note that there is no plan to remove/deprecate the aforementioned adapters in code, but rather adapters are moved into a different folder(mediation/discontinued) within the Mobile SDK repository.
If there is enough interest in certain mediation adapter(s), we are open to the idea of adding them back to our list of supported adapters.

If you have any questions/comments please let us know either via GitHub/or via Xandr Support.
